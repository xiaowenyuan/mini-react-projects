This is a mini React project created as a solution to Activity 6.01 of Packt's The React Workshop book. The data (provided in `products.json`) is provided by Packt, as well as what is expected from a possible solution. I did this without refering to the suggested solution provided in the book. 

The problem requires us to (1) filter the different types of menu items using their tags; and (2) provide expandable information. Apart from React, I also used emotion/css for some practice.  

The full result can be seen live at loremipsumreactcafe.surge.sh.
